# Intercom API OpenApi/Swagger Specification
This is an work in progress to create an OpenAPI3 specification of Intercom's REST API. 

The goal is that, with this specification, it is easier to create SDKs using code generators like
[Swagger CodeGen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/), [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag),
[OpenApi Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator), etc.

it is currently based on v2.2 of Intercom's API.

You can see the endpoints added so far [here](https://intercom-api.docs.stoplight.io/intercom-api-reference).
