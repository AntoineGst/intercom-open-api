# Intercom API OpenApi/Swagger Specification
This is a work in progress to create an OpenAPI3 specification of Intercom's REST API. 

The goal is that, with this specification, it is easier to create SDKs using code generators like
[Swagger CodeGen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/), [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag),
[OpenApi Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator), etc.

It is currently based on v2.2 of Intercom's API.

You can see the endpoints added so far [here (Stoplight version)](https://intercom-api.docs.stoplight.io/intercom-api-reference) 
and [here (Swagger UI version)](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/FinanzaPro/Intercom/2.2).
